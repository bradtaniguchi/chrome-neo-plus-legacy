# api

This app is design as a single project for **all** cloud functions deployed
to firebase. Even though splitting up each of the API calls into their own
library might make more sense, having them all in 1 place will be easier to
start with.

## Running this project

```bash
nx run api:serve
```

## Docs for developing google cloud functions

TBD...
